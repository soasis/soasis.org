- Performance profiling and allocation improvements;
- and, so much more!

We do: [Code Review, and Documentation Writing](/contact/review/); Training or Teaching; [Software Contracting](/contact/contracting/); and, [Software Consulting and Architecture Recommendations](/contact/consulting/). At a high level, there are always two ways to select our expertise:
