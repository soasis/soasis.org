# The Code

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, caste, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants, maintainers, and/or organizers, in any form. For in-person events, sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks. In-person event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the event organizers, and egregious violations will result in a ban from the space entirely. Online participants violating these rules may be barred from participating in the associated spaces.

Our [anti-harassment policy](#anti-harassment) can be found below.

## Anti-Harassment

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of unfair domination related, but not limited to, to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, and caste.

Some examples of harassment include:

- Sexual or inappropriate images in public spaces;
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following;
- Harassing photography or recording;
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events;
- Inappropriate physical contact;
- Unwelcome sexual attention;
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others;
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease;
- Name-calling, slurs (racial or otherwise);
- Hate speech directed at a marginalized or protected group;
- Patterns of trolling, such as tone-policing, bad faith "just asking" to mask hate speech as legitimate debate, and/or violating another's boundaries;
- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect other members or other vulnerable people from intentional abuse;
- Publication of non-harassing private communication that identify individuals;
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

We do not condone these behaviors and if someone is found engaging in these policies, they will be asked to stop. If they do not stop, then [Enforcement](#enforcement) actions will be taken.



## Examples of Good Behavior

There are many ways you can engage professionally and positively with your fellow community members.


- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.



## Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues. This includes online and in-person, as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business and/or actions.

Actions outside of events or dedicated online spaces that demonstrate that a person or group of people are dangerous to the physical, mental, or emotional well-being of our attendees jeopardizes that person or group of people's ability to attend and participate in this space and any associated spaces.



## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

In-person events, specifically: exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor booths, vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the [anti-harassment policy](#anti-harassment)). In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

In general: if a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the repository or event, **with no refund or redress for related expenses, if any**.

Organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. Participants are expected to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. (We also think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!)


### Exceptions

Discussion or images related to discriminatory language and practices is welcome if it **meets all of the following criteria**:

1. the organizers have granted express or implied permission in writing (e.g., by approving a talk on the history of Women in Computing in the United States, or Religious Patriarchy in East Asian Cultures and how it Relates to STEM Careers, etc.);
2. it is necessary to the topic of discussion and no alternative exists;
3. it is presented in a respectful manner, especially towards under-represented minorities in the context of the discussion;
4. attendees are warned in advance in the program and respectfully given ample warning and opportunity to leave beforehand.

This exception specifically does not allow use of gratuitous sexual or uncensored pornographic images as attention-getting devices or unnecessary examples.



## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible.

When the event is in person, event staff can be identified by t-shirts/special badges/head sets. When the event is online, event staff will be clearly highlighted and marked in the appropriate platform.

In general: if you witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify staff or organizers as soon as possible. Standing up for people by accurately reporting what happened is one of the best things you can do as someone not directly targeted or affected!

Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our online and offline work and events for everyone. We want you to enjoy our work and experience unfettered professional growth. People like you make this a better place, and therefore we do not accept violations of the Code of Conduct.

You can make a report [personally](#personal-reporting) if something goes wrong.


### Personal Reporting

You can make a personal report by sending an e-mail to the designated contact person above or by sending an e-mail to one of the designated maintainers at the top of this file. You may also directly speak with a Staff member when one is available during the event. Staff members will be clearly marked by a special symbol and their names published for the duration of the event. A phone number will be available during in-person events. This phone number will be continuously monitored for the duration of any in-person events.

When taking a personal report for in-person events, staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.



## Accountability

Part of the Code of Conduct is ensuring that, if violations happens, they are addressed by Staff in a timely and appropriate manner. By the end of every year for online interactions and shortly after any in-person or online event has ended, a list of any violations will be published. Identifying information will be removed. The incident list, for each violation, will include:

- a general description of what happened;
- the severity of what happened;
- the number of individuals involved;
- the staff member spoken to or the means of contact; and
- any action taken to address the situation and help the affected person or people.

This ensures that attendees know exactly how problems are handled, and so that everyone involved in working in this space or at an in-person event has confidence their problems are handled, even if reports are submitted anonymously.


### Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify one of the staff or the event organizers with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with the code of conduct.




# Last, but not Least

We look forward to a productive and wonderful experience with you!
