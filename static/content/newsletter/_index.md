# For thinking, and chuckling.

<div class="newsletter">
Delivered right to <span class="green">your inbox</span>.

Read about <span>Standardization</span> from the folks who have successfully passed papers and revived dead proposals in C and C++. Peek at <span class="orange">Rust</span> and <span class="yellow">WASM</span> fun. Learn about common problems and their solutions. Gaze into the <span class="green">next level</span> of language and library design.

And occasionally, <span class="green">laugh</span> at some jokes.

It's all here. Experts. Beginners. Somewhere in-between! No spam, and we don't give your e-mail out to anyone. Just fun takes. (And sometimes <span class="pink">hot</span> ones too.)

Feel free to catch [up on previous letters here](https://buttondown.email/Soasis/archive) and [plug in via RSS](https://buttondown.email/Soasis/rss)!
