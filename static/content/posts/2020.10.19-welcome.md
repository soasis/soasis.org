We are so glad you're here!
<!--more-->

We're a software consulting company that has been around for a little while and after spreading by Word of Mouth for a while have decided to become more generally available to people and companies all over the world! To aid in that, we've built this website. It's newly minted and we feel like there is a lot we can share here with everyone.

If you are interested in our open source projects and supporting those, look at our [about](/about/) page. If you are looking to contract or consult us for a project or job, feel free to head to [contact us](/contact/).

We look forward to meeting you, working with you, and advancing the field of Systems Programming together!
