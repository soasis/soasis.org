**Contracting** with Shepherd's Oasis is a simple endeavor: you have a goal, project or target, we have the skills to get it done. It is different from **[Consulting](/contact/consulting/)**, where we are more responsible for the overall architecture and gluing together of the code. For contracting, we take responsibility for the specified deliverables on an agreed upon time frame, with prominent communication about project updates. Cost varies with the size of the task and the necessary time to completion.

Please do reach out and help us make sure your systems keep running!
