**Opensource** with Shepherd's Oasis helps make navigating the space of freely available libraries simple! We generally do whatever work is necessary to support your company with regards to the framework or library that already exists. These are smaller, simpler support contracts that can vary in size:

- Taking a pre-existing library and maintaining it for an older toolchain for compatibility, porting fixes;
- Adding much-needed components and functionality to an existing library or tool;
- Helping get a newer project off of the ground;
- Introducing integrations such as build systems into existing projects to tie them into your project;
- and more!

See [our Opensource page](/opensource) for more details about things we work on!

Please do reach out below to start the conversation about how we can ensure you leverage open source for your needs!
