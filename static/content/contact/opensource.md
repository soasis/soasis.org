**Opensource** with Shepherd's Oasis helps make navigating the space of freely available libraries simple! We generally do whatever work is necessary to support your company with regards to the framework or library that already exists. These are smaller, simpler support contracts that can vary in size:

- Taking a pre-existing library and maintaining it for an older toolchain for compatibility, porting fixes;
- Adding much-needed components and functionality to an existing library or tool;
- Helping get a newer project off of the ground;
- Introducing integrations such as build systems into existing projects to tie them into your project;
- and more!

We have done this before for many open source libraries and open standardization endeavors, most notably:

- [sol2](sol2.readthedocs.io/);
- [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/);
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/);
- [C++'s P1629](https://wg21.link/p1629);
- [C's N2595](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2595.pdf);
- and more!

Please do reach out below to start the conversation about how we can ensure you hit your targets!
