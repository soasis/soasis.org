**Code Review** gives Shepherd's Oasis a chance to look over your code and provide more targeted feedback than general training or classes. Cost is correlated with scope, type, and size of the review. Code reviews can be for:

- Quality assurance;
- Avoiding common pitfalls;
- Reducing classes of errors;
- Producing optimal code;
- Build system quality;
- Leveraging newer features or toolsets;
- Performance recommendations;
- and more!

Please, tell us more about what we should be looking for to help you hit your big-picture goals!
