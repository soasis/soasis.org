Looking for a more specific kind of help? Look into [Code Review](/contact/review/), [Contracting](/contact/contracting/), [Consulting](/contact/consulting/), [Diversity & Inclusivity](/contact/inclusivity/), or [Open Source](/contact/opensource/). There are two approaches to any of these options:

- Interface with the company and receive a statement of objectives, intent, and a plan; or
- Grab one of our skilled people for a duration of time and integrate them more fully into your team.

Either is just fine!
