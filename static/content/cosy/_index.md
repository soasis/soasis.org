<h1>We're excited! üéâ</h1>
<p>Providing a great conference experience has us eager to move things forward. We want a community that makes everyone, especially the most vulnerable, feel welcome. We do this by prioritizing the comfort of the least powerful and centering their voices and comfort with a firm <a href="/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, part of the requirements for Shepherd's Oasis events is public, openly-accessible transparency and accountability for everything that happens. We take both inclusive environment cultivation as well as abuse prevention and mitigation into account for our event structure and organizational work!</p>
