<h1>A Conference Centering Us</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Computing Systems Technology Conference (CoSy Tech Con). <strong>CoSy</strong> (pronounced like "cozy") is a Systems Programming Conference open to developers from all walks of life, both professional and non-professional, who want to engage other like-minded individuals for an intimate and wonderful blend of content.</p>

<h1>When ‚åö</h1>
<p>The conference will take place <strong>Late Fall 2021</strong>. (Or just <strong>sometime around October, give or take a month</strong>, for those who are in the Southern Hemisphere!) We will provide an exact date later to ensure we can avoid the bulk of other similarly-themed conferences around this time. It will take place on or close to a weekend to allow for maximum participation from around the globe. We will make recordings available for the general public later on in some fashion, unless the speaker explicitly requests us not to.</p>

<h1>We're excited! üéâ</h1>
<p>Providing a great conference experience has us eager to move things forward. We want a community that makes everyone, especially the most vulnerable, feel welcome. We do this by prioritizing the comfort of the least powerful and centering their voices and comfort with a firm <a href="/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, part of the requirements for Shepherd's Oasis events is public, openly-accessible transparency and accountability for everything that happens. We take both inclusive environment cultivation as well as abuse prevention and mitigation into account for our event structure and organizational work!</p>
