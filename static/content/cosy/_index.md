<h1>When ‚åö</h1>
<p>The conference will take place <strong>Late Fall 2021</strong>. We will provide a date a little bit closer to the time to ensure we can avoid the bulk of other similarly-themed conferences around this time. Speaker submissions will open up around February 2021, and accepted talks will be notified by the end of the Summer or earlier! It will take place on or close to a weekend to allow for maximum participation from around the globe! We will make recordings available for the general public later on in some fashion, unless the speaker explicitly requests us not to!</p>

<h1>We're excited! üéâ</h1>
<p>Providing a great conference experience has us eager to move things forward. We want a community that makes everyone, especially the most vulnerable, feel welcome. We do this by prioritizing the comfort of the least powerful and centering their voices and comfort. We have a firm <a href="/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> that makes transparency and accountability necessary for our event structure, and we are confident in our team to deliver on where others have failed in meeting the Social Contract.</p>
<p>We'll share more information in the coming months. Don't forget to <a href="/newsletter/">subscribe to the newsletter</a> to keep on top of these things. See you there! üíô</p>
