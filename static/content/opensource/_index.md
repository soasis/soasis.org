There are so many projects that we are working on to make truly open source and available for everyone. We have done this before for many open source libraries and open standardization endeavors, most notably:

- [sol2](https://sol2.readthedocs.io/);
- [ztd.text](https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/);
- [Clang and libc++ improvements, customizations, and fixes](https://clang.llvm.org/);
- [GCC and libstdc++ improvements, customizations, and fixes](https://gcc.gnu.org/);
- and more!

If you are interested in our publicly funded and publicly-visible endeavors, please feel free to peruse, donate, and contribute at your leisure in these various places:

The money here goes to helping the [Project Editor for the C Programming Language](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/contacts), sponsoring certain features in Open Source, funding [CoSy]() and funding various projects like the ones mentioned above! We will also continue to invest in the community alongside you to ensure a better Systems Programming world. Thank you to all of the sponsors, donors, subscribers and more to our work for the community.
